Quality of Life mod for Secrets of Grindea using Grindless.

Changelist:
* Special effects in equipment previews use custom text instead of the generic "Special Effect" text
* Loot chance now uses a pseudo-random distribution for low drop chance items
* Berserker has reduced EP gain on hit and no passive EP drain
* Summon Plant has improved lifetime logic
* Summon Plant's Boss plant now has a radius indicator for plant buff
* Textboxes in game now allow moving the cursor and editing in the middle of text
* Frosty's Silver Charge HP now scales correctly off of MATK (150% -> 200%)
* You can now switch to Normal+ difficulty in Story. This is (almost) the same as Arcade's Catalyst of Power (or Difficulty = 1 for devs)
